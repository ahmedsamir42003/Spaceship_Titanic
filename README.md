# Spaceship_Titanic
This repository contains the code and files related to my participation in the Kaggle competition for predicting  whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly.

## Competition Description

In the year 2912, the Spaceship Titanic encountered a spacetime anomaly while on its maiden voyage. As a result, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. Our mission is to utilize data science skills to investigate the anomaly and uncover the fate of the passengers.
